      For example, you invite your friend, John, the referee. For his first purchase, he chooses Monthly Pro Member services. He gets a discount of 2.9USD and pays 26.1USD for monthly subscription instead of 29USD. Or he chooses Annual Pro Member services for his first purchase, he gets a discount of 31.9USD and pays 287.1USD for yearly subscription instead of 319USD.

        * If he pays 29USD/month firstly and some time later upgrades to 319USD/year, he can only get a discount of 2.9USD upon his first payment. <strong><u>So, Annual Pro Member services recommended for the first subscription to gain more discount as a referee</u></strong>.
